## 🚀 Migration Flow Summary

### 🔹 Phase 1 — Discovery & Planning

Tools Used:

* **AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS)**
* **AWS Migration Hub**

Activities:

* Inventory servers and applications
* Identify dependencies
* Choose migration strategy (6 R’s)
* Set migration home region

---

### 🔹 Phase 2 — Migration Execution

Tools Used:

* **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**
* **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**
* **AWS DataSync + EFS**

Activities:

* Install migration agents on on-prem servers
* Replicate workloads to AWS
* Launch test servers in AWS
* Validate applications and databases post-cutover

---

### 🔹 Phase 3 — Monitoring & Validation

Tools Used:

* **AWS Migration Hub**
* **Amazon Athena (for ADS data analysis)**

Activities:

* Verify migrated servers and data
* Query migration data through Athena
* Perform validation testing and performance checks

---

### 🔹 Phase 4 — Optimization

Tools Used:

* **AWS Compute Optimizer, CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor**
* **AWS Budgets, Security Hub, Systems Manager, Backup**

Activities:

* Right-size instances and databases
* Implement automation and backups
* Enforce IAM security best practices
* Optimize cost and enable monitoring dashboards

## ⚠️ Key Migration Challenges

| Category          | Common Issue                  | Mitigation                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Assessment**    | Incomplete dependency mapping | Use AWS Application Discovery Service           |
| **Data Transfer** | Bandwidth limitations         | Use DataSync, Snowball, or Direct Connect       |
| **Downtime**      | Database sync delays          | Use DMS with CDC replication                    |
| **Licensing**     | Non-portable licenses         | Use BYOL or License-Included AMIs               |
| **Security**      | IAM misconfigurations         | Implement least privilege and Config monitoring |
| **Cost**          | Oversized resources           | Use Compute Optimizer and Budgets               |

## 🏁 Final Note

> “Migration doesn’t end when the servers are live — it ends when your workloads are secure, cost-efficient, and automated.”

This repository serves as a **complete migration lifecycle reference**, from **assessment → execution → optimization**.
Perfect for learning, internal documentation, or interview preparation.
